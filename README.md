## Description
We were assigned the task of refactoring a book search engine application by replacing it's RESTFUL API system with one that utlizes MERN Stack.

## Learning Experience
Working on this project was a great opportunity to practice working graphQL, Apollo and React.jsx. To be more specific, I learned quite a bit about writing out typeDefs, queries and mutations within resolvers, authMiddleware, gql strings, and moving around elements dynamically through the use of React's DOM and React's Router DOM.
